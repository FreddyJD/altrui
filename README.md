# why?
A friend's family member died because an influencer decided to comment on a public podcast about the campaign. He said that the person running the campaign didn't have covid-19. GoFundMe retained the funds, then the hospital couldn't keep him. He died two days after.

Thank You Influencers, Thank You Venezuela, and especially Thank You GoShitMe.
